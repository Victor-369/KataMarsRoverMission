# Description of project
## Mars Rover Mission

### Your Task
Youâ€™re part of the team that explores Mars by sending remotely controlled vehicles to the surface of the planet. Develop software that translates the commands sent from Earth to instructions that are understood by the rover.

### Requirements
- You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
- The rover receives a collection of commands. (E.g.) FFRRFFFRL
- The rover can move forward (f).
- The rover can move left/right (l,r).
- Suppose we are on a really weird planet that is square. 200x200 for example :)
- Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given
sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last
possible point, aborts the sequence and reports the obstacle.

### Take into account
- Rovers are expensive; make sure the software works as expected.

# Documentation
## Stack
This is the stack you should need to run this project:
- PHP v8.3.6
- Laravel v12
- MariaDB v11.4

<br>

## Installation
You need Docker to run the MariaDB database. Use the next command in the same folder where you have the `docker-compose.yml` file. Then run the command `docker compose up` or `docker compose up -d` to create a container with a database.

On the server side run `php artisan serve` command to start Laravel as a server.

<br>

## Configuration

On your `.env` file you must have these variables:
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=mars
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

When you connect to the database, you should run migrations with the command `php artisan migrate`. Also execute, on the database, this script on folder `database/migrations/sql/procedures.sql`.

<br>

## Steps
This project works completely in a API RESTful way. Those instructions must follow these steps.

1) /api/reset
    - This just truncates data on tables (rovers and reports) to make a new start.
2) /api/connect
    - "Connects" with Rover vehicle. It is not possible to send commands to Rover if there is no connection.
3) /api/commands/{commandsList}
    - You are able to send commands to Rover on `{commandsList}`. Those commands are:
        - F: Moves Rover forward one square on the direction (N, E, S, W) it is aiming.
        - L: Turn Rover 90 degrees to the left.
        - R: Turn Rover 90 degrees to the right.
    - Direction is where Rover is aiming. Might be North, East, South or West.
    - Only accepts those three commands and no more than ten (10) commands at a time.

## Reports
Rover warns when finds an obstacle on its way and sends the information to entity Reports on database.
